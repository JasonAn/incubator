My goal in this project is by analysing the reviews from yelp data set to figure out: \r\n\r\n1st, what does the frequency of people writing detailed reviews mean? Or when are people more likely to leave long and detailed reviews? \r\n2nd, what does the length of a review mean? Or when people write a longer review than normal, what is his general attitude? Is it appreciation or criticism?\r\n\r\nBy analysing reviews from yelp data. I am surprised to find that\r\n\r\nWhen customers are more satisfied than the average of 4 stars, the more expensive the food they have, the more likely they write reviews. That's to say, people are more willing to share their experiences. \r\n![plot 2](images/plot2.png)\r\n\r\nAnother issue from the analysis is, when the review is longer, it is usually less positive. Businessmen should pay more attention to the long and detailed reviews on their yelp page, as these are more likely to be complaints toward the services. \r\n![plot 1](images/plot1.png)",
